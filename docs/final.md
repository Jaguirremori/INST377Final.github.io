### Information Problem
The information problem is that the residents of College Park/Prince Georgeâ€™s County may not know about polling places where they can practice their civic right to vote. This could be due to the information not being readily available or difficulty when navigating through the information.
### Our Stakeholders
Any Prince George's County resident that is of voting age or will be of voting age by the Maryland Primary Election or the United States General Election is a stakeholder for our project. The government of Prince George's County will also be a stakeholder as we hope they see our project will be an improvement on their current map.

### Future Plans
There is a couple of features we would like in the future. The first would be to incorporate facets in order to filter the results for each user. Ths feature would allow the uses to eliminate certain polling stations that does not fit their criteria. The second  feature is to add a form where users can enter their address and the website will show them all polling locations within a specified mileage radius to their address. By eliminating non-feasible polling statons we minimize how much much informaton theser see and avoid the risk of informatiom overload. Finally, we would like to create a plugin that adds information about a selected marker or location from the list to the sidebar of the website. this would the user to compare information of dfferent polling places and make the most informed decision they can.
