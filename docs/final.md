### Information Problem
The information problem is that the residents of College Park/Prince Georgeâ€™s County may not know about polling places where they can practice their civic right to vote. This could be due to the information not being readily available or difficulty when navigating through the information.
### Our Stakeholders
Any Prince George's County resident that is of voting age or will be of voting age by the Maryland Primary Election or the United States General Election is a stakeholder for our project. The government of Prince George's County will also be a stakeholder as we hope they see our project will be an improvement on their current map.
