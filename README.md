# Polling Location Map of Prince George's County
## Description:
This project is made with the objective of informing Prince George's County residents about the polling locations where they may go vote in upcoming elections. The application consists of a map containing all the polling stations within the county. Upon clicking a marker on the map, the user will be passed through to a google maps webpage of the polling location, thus providing an image of the physical location along with the option to use directions to navigate there.
